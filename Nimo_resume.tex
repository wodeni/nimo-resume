% IMPORTANT: THIS TEMPLATE NEEDS TO BE COMPILED WITH XeLaTeX
%
% This template uses several fonts not included with Windows/Linux by
% default. If you get compilation errors saying a font is missing, find the line
% on which the font is used and either change it to a font included with your
% operating system or comment the line out to use the default font.

%
% TODO:
% 1. Integrate biber/bibtex for article citation under publications.
% 2. Figure out a smoother way for the document to flow onto the next page.
% 3. Add styling information for a "Projects/Hacks" section.
% 4. Add location/address information
% 5. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% CHANGELOG:
% v1.1:
% 1. Fixed several compilation bugs with \renewcommand
% 2. Got Open-source fonts (Windows/Linux support)
% 3. Added Last Updated
% 4. Move Title styling into .sty
% 5. Commented .sty file.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Known Issues:
% 1. Overflows onto second page if any column's contents are more than the
% vertical limit
% 2. Hacky space on the first bullet point on the second column.

    Penrose is a system that automatically visualizes mathematics.  The system, comprised of two domain-specific languages
    % : Substance models mathematical notations, and Style specifies the visual semantics of Substance, allowing
    , allows users to create professional diagrams by simply typing mathematical notations. I \textbf{designed and implemented the Style language}, and extended the Substance language to support functions and logically quantified statements. The work was presented at  \href{https://conf.researchr.org/event/dsldi-2017/dsldi-2017-substance-and-style-domain-specific-languages-for-mathematical-diagrams}{DSLDI 2017}, co-located with SPLASH 2017. \textit{(Co-advised by \textbf{\href{https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./aldrich/}{Jonathan Aldrich}}, \textbf{\href{https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/}{Keenan Crane}}, \textbf{\href{http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jssunshi/}{Joshua Sunshine}}, and \textbf{\href{https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kqy/}{Katherine Ye}})}

\descript{| Research at Columbia University}
\location{Jan 2017 - May 2017 | New York, NY}
Supervised by \textbf{\href{http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~feiner/}prof. Steven Feiner}, I participated in the CAVIAR project, in which we built an AR application that visualizes cyber affordance in indoor and outdoor environments. Learned Unity and Hololens development and investigated the construction of 3D models from GIS data.
